# Data Representation

## Number Systems and Representations
### Computer Number Representation
- Computers manipulate numbers, usually represented in binary format.
- The most common number representation is in base 10, followed by binary (base 2).
- Binary allows easy representation with on/off switches, facilitating manipulation by digital logic in hardware.

### Number Notations
- Notations include base 10 (decimal), base 2 (binary), base 16 (hexadecimal), and base 8 (octal).
- Conversion between notations can be achieved by repeatedly dividing by the base and taking remainders.

#### (Decimal to Binary) Example:
To convert 10 to binary, you can repeatedly divide 10 by 2, taking note of the remainders. The remainders in reverse order give the binary representation: 1010.

#### (Binary to Decimal) Example:
To convert 1111101 to decimal, you can use the positional notation. The number is calculated as (1 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) + (1 x 2^4) + (1 x 2^3) + (1 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0) = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 125.

#### (Hexadecimal to Decimal) Example:
To convert the hexadecimal number 1F4 to decimal, you can expand the number into its positional notation. 1F4 is equivalent to (1 x 16^2) + (15 x 16^1) + (4 x 16^0) = 256 + 240 + 4 = 500.

#### (Octal to Decimal) Example:
To convert the octal number 74 to decimal, use the positional notation. 74 is equivalent to (7 x 8^1) + (4 x 8^0) = 56 + 4 = 60.

### Floating Point Representation
- Floating-point notation represents numbers as a significant and an exponent, allowing for a compact representation of large or small numbers.
- IEEE 754 is a common standard for representing floating-point numbers in computer systems.

To represent the number 0.000000000005 in scientific notation, you can shift the decimal point to the right until there is only one non-zero digit to the left. This results in 5 Ã— 10^(-12).

To represent the decimal number -27.25 in IEEE 754, convert the integral and fractional parts separately. For -27, the binary representation is 11011, and for 0.25, the binary representation is 01. Combining these, the binary representation of -27.25 is 11011.01.

Understanding the basics of number systems and their representations is crucial in computer science and programming. From binary arithmetic to floating-point representations, a solid grasp of these concepts is fundamental for working with data at a low level in computer systems.
