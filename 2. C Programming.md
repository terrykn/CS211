# Learning C

Start by coding and testing small programs. Learn how to use a debugger.

## Why should you learn C?
- C is closer to the machine, making it easier to see the mapping.
- It's a valuable language for understanding computer architecture.
- It's essential for learning to be a computer scientist.

## Comparison with Java
Java uses byte code and a Java Virtual Machine, while C uses compiled code and a compiler like gcc.

## Anatomy of a C Program
Includes sections such as include files, declaration of global variables, main function, declaration of local variables, and code implementation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char cMessage[] = "Hello\n";

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    int i, count;
    count = atoi(argv[1]);
    for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        printf("Hello %d\n", i);
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## C Basics
### Comments
- Comments in C start with /* and end with */.
- They cannot be nested or included within a string.

### Variable Declarations
- Variables have types, which dictate their interpretation and memory space.
- They can be global or local.

```c
int counter;
int startPoint;
```

### Basic Data Types
C supports various data types like char, int, float, and double.

```c
char individual = 'a';
int integers = -15;
float realNumber = -23.6;
double doublePrecision = -23.6;
```

### Arithmetic Operators
C supports standard arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.

```c
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int result = (x + y) * 2; // Result would be 30
```

### Special Operators: ++ and --
C provides special operators like ++ and -- for increment and decrement operations.

### Relational Operators
C includes various relational operators like >, >=, <, <=, ==, and !=.

### Logic and Bit Operators
C includes logical operators like !, &&, and ||, as well as bit operators like ~, &, and |.

### Expressions and Assignments
C supports complex expressions and assignments, with careful attention needed for type conversions.

### Control Statements
C supports various control statements like if-else, switch, while, for, and do-while.

```c
int index = 0;
int sum = 0;
while ((index >= 0) && (index <= 20)) {
    index += 1;
    if (index == 11) break;
    if ((index % 2) == 1) continue;
    sum = sum + index;
}
```

### Functions and Function Calls
C functions are similar to Java methods and allow for code modularity and reusability.

```c
int Factorial(int n) {
    int i;
    int result = 1;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        result *= i;
    return result;
}
```

### Function Prototypes
Function prototypes can be declared without specifying implementations, allowing for separate compilation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int addNumbers(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10, sum;
    sum = addNumbers(num1, num2); // Function call
    printf("Sum: %d", sum);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Input and Output Handling
C includes a variety of I/O functions in the standard C library, such as printf and scanf.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &number); // Input from the user
    printf("You entered: %d", number); // Output
    return 0;
}
```

## Memory and Pointers
### Memory and Pointers Basics
C's memory model matches the underlying virtual memory system, with variables as names for contiguous sequences of bytes. Pointers are used for indirection and memory management.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr;
    int num = 5;
    ptr = &num;
    printf("Value of num = %d\n", num); // Output: 5
    printf("Address of num = %p\n", &num); // Output: Address of num
    printf("Value of ptr = %p\n", ptr); // Output: Address of num
    printf("Value at the address stored in ptr = %d\n", *ptr);
    // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```

### Pointer Basics and Arithmetic
C supports pointer operations like address computation and dereferencing.

### Arrays and Pointer Relations
Arrays and pointers have a close relationship in C, with arrays essentially acting as pointers to the first element in the array.

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr; // store address of first element in a pointer

printf("Value of the first element: %d\n", *ptr); // print the value of the first element

// Accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic
printf("Second element of the array: %d\n", *(ptr + 1)); // access the second element

// Modifying array elements using pointers
*(ptr + 2) = 6; // change the value of the third element

printf("Modified third element: %d\n", arr[2]); // print the modified value
```

### Dynamic Allocation
C provides functions like malloc and free for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr, i , n;
    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    ptr = (int*) malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // Memory allocation
    if(ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory not allocated.");
        exit(0);
    }
    printf("Enter elements: ");
    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", ptr + i);
    }
    printf("Entered elements: ");
    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", *(ptr + i));
    }
    free(ptr); // Freeing memory
    return 0;
}
```

## Structures and Preprocessor
### Structures in C
C includes the concept of structures to group related data items of different types.

### Using typedef
The typedef keyword is used to give an alias to existing data types, improving code clarity and ease of use.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure representing a point in 2D space
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

int main() {
    // Declare a variable of type Point
    Point p1;

    // Assign values to the members of the Point struct
    p1.x = 10;
    p1.y = 20;

    // Print the values of the Point struct


    printf("Coordinates of the point: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);

    // Declare a new type 'Point' using the typedef keyword
    Point p2;
    
    // Assign values to the members of the 'Point' data type
    p2.x = 5;
    p2.y = 15;

    // Print the values of the 'Point' data type
    printf("Coordinates of the point: (%d, %d)\n", p2.x, p2.y);

    return 0;
}
```

### Preprocessor Directives
The C preprocessor is used to manipulate the source code before compilation and is controlled by directives like #include and #define.

## Standard C Library and System Calls
### Standard C Library
The Standard C Library provides a collection of useful functions and macros for various operations like I/O and string handling.

### Command Line Arguments
Command line arguments in C are handled using the argc and argv parameters in the main function.

### System Calls
C provides a mechanism to access the functionalities of the underlying operating system through system calls.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("No arguments provided.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The provided argument is: %s\n", argv[1]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## File Handling

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    char str[60];

    fp = fopen("file.txt", "w+");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Error in opening file");
        return -1;
    }

    fprintf(fp, "This is written to the file.");
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET);
    fgets(str, 60, fp);
    printf("Read from the file: %s\n", str);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

## Multidimensional Arrays
### 2D Arrays
```c
int m[3][3];
// m[0], m[1], m[2] are arrays of integers
// m is an array of arrays of integers
// m[0][0] is an integer

// Example of individual element access
int val = m[0][0];

// sizeof(m) gives the total size of the array
// sizeof(m[0]) gives the size of the first row
// sizeof(m[0][0]) gives the size of an individual element
```

### Multidimensional Array Indexing
- Array indexing uses the address of the array and the element size
- Multiply index and element size to get the offset
- The compiler can compute these offsets based on the known dimensions of the array

```c
int m[ROWS][COLS];
int *p = m[10]; // p = m + 10 * COLS * sizeof(int)
int q = p[5]; // &p[5] = p + 5 * sizeof(int)
int r = m[10][5]; // &m[10][5] = m + (10 * COLS + 5) * sizeof(int)
```

### Passing Multidimensional Arrays to Functions
- Multidimensional arrays can be passed to functions with the first dimension dropped

```c
void transpose(double matrix[][3]);
void something_else(int voxels[][100][100]);
```

### Multi-Level Arrays
- Multidimensional arrays must be rectangular (all rows the same length) for consistent indexing
- Working with multidimensional arrays on the heap is challenging without specifying dimensions
- Arrays of pointers can be used to manage multi-level arrays
