# Trends in Computer Architecture
---
## Major Components

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Executes instructions and performs calculations.
2. **Memory:** Stores data and instructions for the CPU.
3. **System bus:** Connects all the components of the computer system.
4. **IO bus:** Facilitates communication between the CPU and IO devices.
5. **Storage:** Non-volatile memory for long-term data storage.
6. **IO peripherals:** Devices for input and output operations.

## Key Trends

1. **Exponential growth of transistor count (Moore's Law):** Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years, leading to increased computing power.
2. **Processor-memory speed gap (Caches):** Caches are used to mitigate the speed gap between the processor and the memory by storing frequently accessed data closer to the CPU.
3. **"Power wall"/"multicore crisis":** The "power wall" refers to the limitations on a processor's power consumption, leading to challenges in increasing clock speed. The "multicore crisis" highlights the need for efficient programming to leverage the benefits of multi-core processors.
