# Assembly Programming (Intel X86)

## High-level ideas
Assembly language serves as a bridge between machine code and high-level programming languages. It uses mnemonic codes and symbols to represent instructions and data. Unlike high-level languages, assembly language provides a direct and low-level interaction with the hardware, enabling precise control over the processor.

## Fetch/execute cycle
The fetch-execute cycle is the fundamental process of the CPU. It involves several steps:
- Fetch: The CPU fetches the next instruction from memory.
- Decode: It decodes the instruction to understand what operation it needs to perform and what data it needs.
- Execute: It executes the operation on the fetched data.
- Write back: It writes the results back to the memory if necessary.

## Opcode and operands
- Opcode (operation code) - specifies the operation to be performed, such as addition, subtraction, or data movement.
- Operands - the data on which the operation is performed. These can be registers, memory locations, or immediate values.

## Operation types
- `mov`: The `mov` (move) instruction copies data from one location to another.
- Arithmetic and logic: These operations include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and other bitwise operations.
- Control: Control operations alter the flow of the program based on certain conditions, such as jumps and branches.

## IA32/X86 assembly (AT&T/GAS style)
IA32 and x86 assembly languages are widely used for Intel and compatible processors. The AT&T/GAS syntax style is one of the two major syntax styles, known for its use of suffixes and operand order.

### 2-argument form for add, sub, etc.
In the 2-argument form, the first argument represents the destination, and the second argument represents the source.

```assembly
addl %eax, %ebx 	# ebx = ebx + eax
subl %eax, %ebx 	# ebx = ebx - eax
```

### Operand types
- `byte`: 8 bits
- `word`: 16 bits
- `double word`: 32 bits

### Register names
Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. In x86 architecture, common registers include `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `ESP`, and `EBP`, among others.

### Mov instruction
The `mov` instruction is used to copy data from one location to another.

```assembly
movl $20, %eax 	# Moves the immediate value 20 into the eax register
```

### Addressing modes
Addressing modes define how the operands are interpreted in the instruction. Here are some common addressing modes:
- Immediate: The operand is specified in the instruction itself.
- Absolute: The operand is at a fixed memory location.
- Direct: The operand is accessed directly without any offset or register.
- Indirect: The operand is accessed using the contents of a register as a memory address.

### Examples
```assembly
movl $20, %eax		# Loads immediate value 20 into eax register
movl 20, %eax		# Loads value from address 20 into the eax register
movl %ebx, %eax	# Copies value in ebx register into eax register
movl (%ebx,%ecx), %eax	# Loads value from memory location at the sum of the contents of ebx and ecx into the eax register
```

### Push, Pop
- `Push`: The `push` instruction places data onto the stack. For example, `push %eax` would push the value in the `eax` register onto the stack.
- `Pop`: The `pop` instruction retrieves data from the stack. For example, `pop %eax` would pop the topmost value from the stack into the `eax` register.

Understanding assembly language and its intricacies provides developers with a deep understanding of how the CPU processes instructions and data. Mastering assembly language is essential for those who require precise control over hardware and processor-level operations.
